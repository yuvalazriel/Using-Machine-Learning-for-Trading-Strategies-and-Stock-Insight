# Using-Machine-Learning-for-Trading-Strategies-and-Stock-Insight
our final project- Inbar and Yuval

Algorithmic trading is one of the most talked about technologies in the recent years, its start to take over the stock exchange market and replace
the traditional trading strategies. This study aims to understand whether trading strategies based on machine learning (algo-trading) can "beat the market".
We will present a learning model based on the paper: "Applying Deep Learning to Enhance Momentum Trading Strategies in Stocks" that able to discover a version 
of the momentum effect in stocks without extensive hand-engineering of input features.
We will specify each step in the building process- preprocessing, specific learning network, classification etc.
Using the model's results, we will specify the trading strategy and our Verification Plan for it.
